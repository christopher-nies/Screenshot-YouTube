This is a fork of the [Screenshot YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screenshot-youtube/gjoijpfmdhbjkkgnmahganhoinjjpohk) Chrome extension.

I have modiefied the code by adding a custom upload functionality: Now by providing an upload-url and a upload-token you can use services like [imgur](https://imgur.com/) to upload your screenshot directly to that. (Personally I use [Zipline](https://zipline.diced.sh/), a selfhosted service) I have only tested this modified extension with Zipline!

By activating the functionality in the settings one can press `U` to upload an imange and `P` to download.
